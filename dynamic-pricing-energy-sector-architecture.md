# Architecting a System for Dynamic Energy Pricing Models

To implement a dynamic pricing system for the energy sector, we need a scalable, reliable, and secure backend that processes real-time market data, calculates dynamic prices using decision-making algorithms, and integrates seamlessly with the billing system. Below is a practical approach to designing the system, along with key architecture details and relevant code snippets.
