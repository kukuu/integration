# Feature Toggling

Implementing feature toggles or feature flags allows you to control the release of new features in your application without the need for code deployments. This can help you gradually roll out features to different user groups or enable/disable features as needed. Below, I'll demonstrate how to implement feature toggles using the launchdarkly-node-server-sdk library as an example.

By using LaunchDarkly, you can manage your feature toggles remotely without the need to modify the application code or redeploy it. This approach allows you to experiment with new features and safely roll them out to a subset of users before enabling them for all users. Additionally, you can quickly disable features in case of issues or performance concerns.
