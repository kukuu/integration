# Monitoring and Alerting system for improving CD pipeline

Implementing a robust monitoring and alerting system is crucial for detecting and responding to issues in real time. 

Tools: Application monitoring tools (New Relic, Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana), incident tracking systems (ServiceNow). Below are examples of popular tools and a code snippet to showcase how you can set up monitoring and alerting to track the performance and health of the newly implemented systems:


## Monitoring 

_Tools_:

1. Prometheus: An open-source monitoring system that collects and stores metrics from various sources.

2. Grafana: A visualization tool that works with Prometheus to create dashboards and alerts.

3. Node.js Application Metrics (APM): For monitoring Node.js applications, you can use tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Dynatrace.

_Code_:

Assuming you have a Node.js application, you can use libraries like prom-client to expose application metrics, and Prometheus will collect and store those metrics.

```
const express = require('express');
const { collectDefaultMetrics, register } = require('prom-client');

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// Collect default metrics (CPU, memory, etc.) and expose them through /metrics endpoint
collectDefaultMetrics();

// Your application-specific metrics
const customMetric = new client.Gauge({
  name: 'custom_metric',
  help: 'Example custom metric',
  labelNames: ['status'],
});

// Simulate an endpoint that updates the custom metric
app.get('/update-metric/:status', (req, res) => {
  const { status } = req.params;
  customMetric.labels(status).inc();
  res.send('Metric updated.');
});

// Expose metrics endpoint for Prometheus scraping
app.get('/metrics', (req, res) => {
  res.set('Content-Type', register.contentType);
  res.end(register.metrics());
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});

```


## Alerting:

In Grafana, you can create alert rules based on your application metrics. For example, you can set up an alert rule to trigger an email notification when the custom_metric exceeds a certain threshold.

The combination of Prometheus, Grafana, and Node.js APM tools provides comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities. By setting up custom metrics and alerts, you can quickly detect issues in your application, such as high error rates, performance degradation, or other critical events, and respond to them in real-time.

Keep in mind that monitoring and alerting should be tailored to your specific application and its requirements.
