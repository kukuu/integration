# Improving operational excellence of DevOps capability

I spearheaded a series of General DevOps practice improvements by introducing a streamlined CI/CD pipeline, leveraging tools like Jenkins and GitLab to automate the deployment process in the delivery of the cloud-based NOTIFICATION platform for FIFA World Cup2022 and recently on the AZZOTTO Digital Broadcasting Platform. 

This resulted in reduced deployment times and improved code quality through automated testing. I established KPI analytics to measure key metrics such as deployment frequency, lead time, and change failure rate, providing valuable insights into our development efficiency and stability.

In terms of monitoring and metrics, I designed and implemented a holistic, multi-tenant platform monitoring system using tools like Prometheus and Grafana. This allowed us to proactively detect and address performance bottlenecks and service disruptions, enhancing our service reliability. By analysing metrics related to uptime, response times, and resource utilisation, optimised our platform's performance and resource allocation.

To ensure service excellence, I actively engaged with stakeholders, both internal and external, to understand their requirements and expectations. By aligning our DevOps practices with their needs, I improved service delivery and customer satisfaction. I played a pivotal role in contributing to strategic and commercial plans by providing insights into technological trends and identifying opportunities for innovation and growth.

Maintaining positive working relationships was crucial. I fostered collaboration among cross-functional teams, enabling efficient communication and knowledge sharing. As a mentor and coach, I supported junior engineers and graduates, offering guidance on complex technical challenges and cultivating a culture of continuous learning. I also served as an escalation point for critical issues, ensuring quick and effective resolutions.

In conclusion, my recent experiences reflect a holistic approach to improving DevOps practices, enhancing monitoring and metrics, driving service excellence, fostering relationships, and nurturing a skilled team. This comprehensive approach has not only led to tangible improvements in our processes and systems but also created a motivated team of problem solvers dedicated to delivering high-quality results.
