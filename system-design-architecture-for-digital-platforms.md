# System Design Architecture for scalable robust digital platforms
Software architecture refers to the high level structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations.

The architecture is a blend of technical decisions and architectural patterns, and considered the root of a software project to ensure its scalability, resilience, robustness, security, quality, cost effectiveness and longevity.

The architecture is made so the code structure can satisfy every software prerequisite that is being developed while exemplifying transversal attributes such as performance, quality, scalability, maintainability, manageability, elasticity and usability.

You can use multiple patterns in a single system to optimize each section of code with the best architecture.

There are many recognized architectural patterns and styles, among them:


```

1. Client-server : 2-tier, 3-tier, n-tier, Cloud computing exhibit this style

2. Layered (or multilayered architecture eg. MVC)

3. Microservices architecture

4. Event Driven  / Implicit invocation 

5. Monolithic application : A monolithic application describes a single-tiered software application in which the user interface and data access code are combined into a single program from a single platform. A monolithic application is self-contained, and independent from other computing applications.

6. Micro-kernael (COTS/Plugin)

7. Publish/Subscribe

8. Component-based

9. Data-centric

```
By combining the technologies, methodologies and practices below, you can successfully build a digital platform that will be highly scalable, reliable, and maintainable. The platform could efficiently handle growing user loads, recover from failures, and provide actionable insights through comprehensive monitoring and observability. This approach will ensure the platform's resilience and responsiveness, meeting the demands of a dynamic digital landscape.

- Software System Design Architecture: Start by carefully designing the architecture of the digital platform. follow established software engineering standard methodologies such as the SOLID principles, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to ensure a maintainable and scalable system and also Security andProject Management methodolgies and guidelines like OWASP, TOGAF, Agile etc.

- Cloud Technology: Leveraging cloud services, particularly AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, architecting the platform for scalability and reliability. Cloud-native solutions will allow for easy scaling and disaster recovery planning.

- Node.js and TypeScript: Node.js was chosen as the backend runtime due to its efficiency and non-blocking I/O. TypeScript was employed to bring strong typing and improved maintainability to the codebase.

- Microservices and Event-Driven APIs: Divide the platform into microservices (where necessary), each responsible for a specific domain or functionality. Event-driven architecture using message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka facilitated asynchronous communication between these microservices.

- Integration and DevOps: Common integration tasks were streamlined by implementing CI/CD pipelines. Tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI were used to automate testing and deployments. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation was employed for infrastructure provisioning.

- Kubernetes: Containerization using Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes enabled easy management and scaling of microservices. Kubernetes provided features like load balancing, self-healing, and rolling updates.

- Monitoring and Observability: I implemented monitoring and observability solutions using Prometheus and Grafana. This allowed for real-time monitoring of application health, resource utilization, and the ability to set up alerts for proactive issue resolution.

##  How to convert monolithic to Microservices

```

1. Look for probable targets by researching the Monolith and warm up with a simple and fairly decoupled capability. 
   i.e Authentication and then Profile

2. Minimize Dependency Back to the Monolith. i.e Buying and promotion. 
   Buying has dependencies including promotion. Decouple promotions from buying.

3. Split Sticky Capabilities Early.

4. Decouple Vertically and Release the Data Early.

5. Decouple What is Important to the Business and Changes Frequently.

6. Decouple Capability and not Code.

7. Go Macro First, then Micro.

## Software  Design Patterns

### The Constructor Design Pattern

The Constructor Design Pattern is a creational pattern used in software design to create objects by defining a constructor method in a class. It provides a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and behaviors. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to ensure that an object is created with all the necessary attributes initialized properly. It promotes encapsulation and helps in managing object creation complexity, making it a fundamental part of object-oriented design and ensuring that objects are consistent and correctly configured from the start.

### The Module Design Pattern

JavaScript modules are the most prevalently used design patterns for keeping particular pieces of code independent of other components, and consistent. This provides loose coupling to support well-structured code.


For those that are familiar with object-oriented languages, modules are JavaScript "classes". One of the many advantages of classes is encapsulation - protecting states and behaviors from being accessed from other classes. The module pattern allows for public and private (plus the lesser-know protected and privileged) access levels.

Modules should be Immediately-Invoked-Function-Expressions (IIFE) to allow for private scopes - that is, a closure that protect variables and methods.

#### Revealing Module Pattern

A variation of the module pattern is called the Revealing Module Pattern. The purpose is to maintain encapsulation and reveal certain variables and methods returned in an object literal. The direct implementation looks like this.


### Prototype Design Pattern

 The Prototype design pattern relies on the JavaScript prototypical inheritance. The prototype model is used mainly for creating objects in performance-intensive situations.


 The objects created are clones (shallow clones) of the original object that are passed around. One use case of the prototype pattern is performing an extensive database operation to create an object used for other parts of the application. If another process needs to use this object, instead of having to perform this substantial database operation, it would be advantageous to clone the previously created object.


 To clone an object, a constructor must exist to instantiate the first object. Next, by using the keyword prototype variables and methods bind to the object's structure. Let's look at a basic example.

### Revealing Prototype Pattern

Similar to Module pattern, the Prototype pattern also has a revealing variation. The Revealing Prototype Pattern provides encapsulation with public and private members since it returns an object literal.

### Observer Design Pattern

There are many times when one part of the application changes, other parts needs to be updated. In AngularJS, if the $scope object updates, an event can be triggered to notify another component. The observer pattern incorporates just that - if an object is modified it broadcasts to dependent objects that a change has occurred.

Another prime example is the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture; The view updates when the model changes. One benefit is decoupling the view from the model to reduce dependencies.


### Publish/Subscribe

The Publish/Subscribe pattern, however, uses a topic/event channel that sits between the objects wishing to receive notifications (subscribers) and the object firing the event (the publisher). This event system allows code to define application-specific events that can pass custom arguments containing values needed by the subscriber. The idea here is to avoid dependencies between the subscriber and publisher.


Subscribers in the publish/subscribe pattern are notified through some messaging medium, but observers are notified by implementing a handler similar to the subject.

In AngularJS, a subscriber 'subscribes' to an event using $on('event', callback), and a publisher 'publishes' an event using $emit('event', args) or $broadcast('event', args).


### Singleton

A Singleton only allows for a single instantiation, but many instances of the same object. The Singleton restricts clients from creating multiple objects, after the first object created, it will return instances of itself.

Finding use cases for Singletons is difficult for most who have not yet used it prior. One example is using an office printer. If there are ten people in an office, and they all use one printer, ten computers share one printer (instance). By sharing one printer, they share the same resources.


In AngularJS, Singletons are prevalent, the most notable being services, factories, and providers. Since they maintain state and provides resource accessing, creating two instances defeats the point of a shared service/factory/provider.

Race conditions occur in multi-threaded applications when more than one thread tries to access the same resource. Singletons are susceptible to race conditions, such that if no instance were initialized first, two threads could then create two objects instead of returning and instance. This defeats the purpose of a singleton. Therefore, developers must be privy to synchronization when implementing singletons in multithreaded applications.


## Basic Programming Principles Programmers Should Follow

1. SOLID -The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in software engineering that aim to create more maintainable, robust, flexible, extensible, and understandable code for object-oriented software systems and solve particular problems that might arise while developing software systems. Each principle focuses on a specific aspect of software design and encourages practices that lead to modular and well-structured code. The five SOLID principles are:


- Single Responsibility:  This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have a single responsibility or job. This promotes high cohesion, where each class focuses on doing one thing well, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
  
- Open Closed: The Open-Closed Principle suggests that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you can add new functionality without modifying existing code. This is typically achieved through abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
  
- Liskov Substitution: The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, if a class is a subclass of another class, it should be able to be used interchangeably with the parent class without introducing unexpected behaviour.

- Interface Segregation: The Interface Segregation Principle suggests that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. In other words, interfaces should be specific and fine-grained, tailored to the needs of the implementing classes. This prevents classes from being burdened and overloaded with methods they don't need.

 
- Dependency Inversion: The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This promotes loose coupling and flexibility, allowing components to be easily replaced or extended without affecting the entire system.

Following these SOLID principles helps developers create more modular, maintainable, and adaptable software systems. By designing code with these principles in mind, developers can reduce code duplication, improve readability, and make future changes and additions to the codebase smoother and less error-prone.

They work in tandem with the 4 pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance

2. KISS. The “keep it simple, stupid” principle applies to pretty much all of life, but it's especially necessary for medium-to-large programming projects. 

3. DRY: Dont Repeat Yourself

4. Develop iteratively

5. Composition > Inheritance. 

6. Separation of Concerns. 

7. Avoid Premature Optimization.
