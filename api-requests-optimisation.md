# API Requests and Optimisation
Optimizing concurrent Axios API requests involves finding the right balance between the number of requests, payload size, and network capacity. It's essential to consider the specific requirements of your application and the characteristics of the API you are working with. Regularly monitor performance and make adjustments as needed to achieve the best possible efficiency.

To optimize concurrent Axios API requests and maximize efficiency, you can consider the following strategies:

- Limit the Number of Concurrent Requests: Sending too many concurrent requests can overload the server or cause network congestion. To optimize efficiency, you can limit the number of concurrent requests to a reasonable level based on the server's capacity and the nature of the API. You can use libraries like axios-extensions or axios-throttle to control the rate of concurrent requests.
- Use Connection Pooling: To reduce the overhead of establishing new connections for each request, consider implementing connection pooling. Connection pooling allows multiple requests to reuse existing connections to the server, leading to faster response times and reduced resource consumption.
- Batching Requests: If the API allows it, consider batching multiple related requests into a single request. Grouping related requests can reduce the number of round trips to the server and improve overall performance.
- Caching: Implement client-side caching to store responses from previous requests. Caching can reduce the need for redundant API calls and speed up subsequent requests, especially for static or relatively stable data.
- Prioritize Critical Requests: If you have both critical and non-critical requests, prioritize the critical ones to ensure they are processed first. This can be important for real-time applications or time-sensitive operations.
- Optimize Payload Size: Minimize the payload size by only requesting the necessary data from the server. This reduces network latency and improves response times.
- Parallel Execution of Independent Requests: If you have independent requests that do not rely on each other's responses, execute them in parallel. Parallel execution can significantly reduce the overall processing time.
- Compression: Enable response compression on the server-side to reduce the data size sent over the network. Gzip or Brotli compression can be used to compress the response payloads.
- Error Handling: Implement efficient error handling to handle any failures or timeouts in API requests. Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient failures.
- Load Balancing: If the server architecture supports it, use load balancing to distribute the requests across multiple server instances, maximizing server resource utilization and handling large volumes of requests efficiently.
