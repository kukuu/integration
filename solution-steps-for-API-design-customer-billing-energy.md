# Solution Steps for API Design for Customer Billing or Account Management

This solution describes designing RESTful APIs for managing customer accounts and billing in a distributed, high-traffic environment while maintaining data consistency and adhering to best practices.

## Solution Overview (key pillars)

The system must:

- Provide RESTful or GraphQL APIs for customer account creation, updates, and retrieval.

- Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

- Use a scalable and normalized database schema for storing customer and billing data.

- Handle high traffic with caching, rate limiting, and horizontal scalability.

- Include monitoring and logging for debugging and performance tracking.

## Architecture Design

High-Level Architecture:

```
+------------------------------------+
|         Authentication Layer       |
|    OAuth2 / JWT Authentication     |
+------------------------------------+
                    |
                    v
+------------------------------------+
|         API Gateway Layer          |
|  - Load Balancer                   |
|  - Rate Limiting (e.g., Redis)     |
|  - Caching (e.g., Redis, CDNs)     |
+------------------------------------+
                    |
                    v
+---------------------------------------------+
|       Microservices for Account and Billing |
|  1. Customer Account Service                |
|     - REST API for account CRUD             |
|  2. Billing Service                         |
|     - REST API for billing details CRUD     |
+---------------------------------------------+
                    |
                    v
+------------------------------------+
|       Database Layer               |
|  - PostgreSQL for structured data  |
|  - Redis for caching               |
|  - Audit Logs                      |
+------------------------------------+
                    |
                    v
+------------------------------------+
|     Monitoring & Logging Layer     |
|  - Prometheus / Grafana for metrics|
|  - ELK Stack for logs              |
+------------------------------------+

```

## Solution Steps

Step 1: Define API Endpoints

We will design RESTful API endpoints with the following routes for account and billing management:

**Account Service API Endpoints:**

- POST /accounts: Create a new customer account.

- GET /accounts/{id}: Retrieve customer account details.

- PUT /accounts/{id}: Update customer account details.

- DELETE /accounts/{id}: Delete a customer account.

**Billing Service API Endpoints:**

- POST /billing: Create a billing record for a customer.

- GET /billing/{id}: Retrieve billing details for a customer.

- PUT /billing/{id}: Update billing details.

- GET /billing/history/{accountId}: Retrieve billing history for a customer.
