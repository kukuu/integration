# Travel Booking Website Architecture Design

The proposed architecture prioritises scalability, security, and performance to handle millions of search and booking requests. The search mechanism leverages ElasticSearch for high-performance filtering, and Redis ensures fast caching. The architecture integrates modern frontend frameworks like React.js and backend APIs with GraphQL, enabling rich interactions and seamless user experiences. Monitoring tools such as Prometheus and ELK provide reliability and observability for the system in production.

## Clarification Questions: 

i. Scope of the Platform - Should the platform focus only on accommodations, or should it include additional services like flights, activities, and car rentals?

ii. Search Scope - Are we building a simple keyword-based search or adding advanced filters (e.g., price range, amenities, distance, ratings)?

iii. Real-time Updates - Should we support real-time availability updates and dynamic pricing?
