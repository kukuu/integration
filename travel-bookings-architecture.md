# Travel Booking Website Architecture Design

The proposed architecture prioritises scalability, security, and performance to handle millions of search and booking requests. The search mechanism leverages ElasticSearch for high-performance filtering, and Redis ensures fast caching. The architecture integrates modern frontend frameworks like React.js and backend APIs with GraphQL, enabling rich interactions and seamless user experiences. Monitoring tools such as Prometheus and ELK provide reliability and observability for the system in production.

## Clarification Questions: 

i. Scope of the Platform - Should the platform focus only on accommodations, or should it include additional services like flights, activities, and car rentals?

ii. Search Scope - Are we building a simple keyword-based search or adding advanced filters (e.g., price range, amenities, distance, ratings)?

iii. Real-time Updates - Should we support real-time availability updates and dynamic pricing?

## Functional Requirements:

 i. User Features:

    a. Register and log in with secure authentication.

    b. Search accommodations based on filters (location, dates, number of guests).

    c. View accommodation details and reviews.

    d. Make a reservation and receive confirmation.

    e. View booking history and manage bookings.

ii. Admin Features:

    a. Manage property listings (CRUD operations).

    b. Monitor reservations and customer activity.


iii. System Features:

    a. Real-time search results and price updates.

    b. Payment gateway integration.

    c. Reviews and ratings.

    d. Scalability to handle high traffic during peak seasons.


## Non-Functional Requirements:
  
i. Scalability: Handle millions of search requests and bookings per second.

ii. Reliability: Ensure data consistency and failover mechanisms.

iii. Performance: Fast response times (<200ms).

iv. Security: Protect sensitive data and payment details.

v. Observability: Logging, monitoring, and alerts.
