# Travel Booking Website Architecture Design

The proposed architecture prioritises scalability, security, and performance to handle millions of search and booking requests. The search mechanism leverages ElasticSearch for high-performance filtering, and Redis ensures fast caching. The architecture integrates modern frontend frameworks like React.js and backend APIs with GraphQL, enabling rich interactions and seamless user experiences. Monitoring tools such as Prometheus and ELK provide reliability and observability for the system in production.

## Clarification Questions: 

i. Scope of the Platform - Should the platform focus only on accommodations, or should it include additional services like flights, activities, and car rentals?

ii. Search Scope - Are we building a simple keyword-based search or adding advanced filters (e.g., price range, amenities, distance, ratings)?

iii. Real-time Updates - Should we support real-time availability updates and dynamic pricing?

## Functional Requirements:

 i. User Features:

    a. Register and log in with secure authentication.

    b. Search accommodations based on filters (location, dates, number of guests).

    c. View accommodation details and reviews.

    d. Make a reservation and receive confirmation.

    e. View booking history and manage bookings.

ii. Admin Features:

    a. Manage property listings (CRUD operations).

    b. Monitor reservations and customer activity.


iii. System Features:

    a. Real-time search results and price updates.

    b. Payment gateway integration.

    c. Reviews and ratings.

    d. Scalability to handle high traffic during peak seasons.


## Non-Functional Requirements:
  
i. Scalability: Handle millions of search requests and bookings per second.

ii. Reliability: Ensure data consistency and failover mechanisms.

iii. Performance: Fast response times (<200ms).

iv. Security: Protect sensitive data and payment details.

v. Observability: Logging, monitoring, and alerts.

## Deep Dive into Search Mechanism

- Frontend Components:

i. UI Components: Built using React.js with a responsive layout using Tailwind CSS.

ii. State Management: Redux Toolkit or Context API to manage state across components.

iii. Search Filtering: Dynamic filters like price sliders, date pickers, and keyword search.

iv. Debouncing and Throttling: Optimized search queries to avoid overloading servers.

- Search APIs and Data Flow:

i. API Gateway routes the request to the Search Service.

ii. Search Service interacts with ElasticSearch for full-text and geo-spatial queries.

iii. Redis Cache stores frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

iv. Real-time updates are handled using WebSockets or GraphQL Subscriptions.

## Data Model

- Entities:

i. User

ID, Name, Email, Password (hashed), Role.

ii. Listing

ID, Title, Description, Price, Ratings, Location (GeoJSON).


iii. Booking

ID, User ID, Listing ID, Date, Status.


iv. Reviews

ID, User ID, Listing ID, Rating, Comment.


v. Payments

ID, Booking ID, Payment Status, Transaction ID.


## Optimizations and Trade-offs

i. Scalability: Use CDNs for static assets and auto-scaling clusters (Kubernetes) for backend services.

ii. Caching: Leverage Redis for frequently searched data and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

iii. Real-time Updates: Use WebSockets for live notifications and updates.

iii. Security: Implement JWT-based token authentication, rate-limiting, and secure payment processing (PCI-DSS).

iv. Monitoring: Deploy Prometheus and ELK for logs and system metrics.
