1. Clarification Questions: 

i. Scope of the Platform - Should the platform focus only on accommodations, or should it include additional services like flights, activities, and car rentals?

ii. Search Scope - Are we building a simple keyword-based search or adding advanced filters (e.g., price range, amenities, distance, ratings)?

iii. Real-time Updates - Should we support real-time availability updates and dynamic pricing?
