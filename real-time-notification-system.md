# Real-Time Notification System

The system will handle real-time notifications for energy customers, such as alerts for dynamic pricing changes, energy usage updates, or system outages. It must be scalable, fault-tolerant, and meet regulatory requirements for data privacy.

## Solution Steps

 ### Key Requirements

- Real-time notifications for customers (via SMS, email, push notifications).

- Scalability to handle millions of users and notifications.

- Fault-tolerance to ensure reliable delivery even during system failures.

- Regulatory compliance, ensuring GDPR compliance and protecting customer data.

### System Workflow

- Event Trigger: Notifications are triggered by events such as pricing changes, energy usage thresholds, or system outages.

- Event Streaming: Events are ingested in real time using tools like Apache Kafka or AWS SNS.

- Processing Layer: A microservice processes events, formats notifications, and decides the appropriate delivery channel (SMS, email, push).

- Notification Delivery: Delivery through external providers like Twilio, SendGrid, or Firebase.

- Monitoring and Retries: Failed notifications are logged, and retry mechanisms ensure eventual delivery.

```
- Key Components

i. Event Sources: Events originate from pricing APIs, energy usage data, or alerts.

ii. Event Streaming Layer: Kafka ensures scalable, fault-tolerant event ingestion.

iii. Data Processing Layer: Microservices handle business logic, such as formatting messages and routing them to the correct channel.

iv. Delivery Channels: Integrate with third-party services (e.g., Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email).

v. Observability: Tools like Prometheus or ELK Stack monitor delivery metrics and failures.


## Code Examples

- Event Streaming with Kafka

```
from kafka import KafkaProducer

producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

# Event data for notification
event = {
    "user_id": "12345",
    "event_type": "pricing_update",
    "message": "Your energy rate has changed to $0.12 per kWh."
}

# Publish event to Kafka
producer.send('notifications', value=event)
producer.flush()
print("Event published to Kafka.")

```

- Processing and Notification Microservice

```
from flask import Flask, request
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
import requests

app = Flask(__name__) 


# Kafka Consumer
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'notifications',
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    group_id='notification-group',
    auto_offset_reset='earliest',
    value_deserializer=lambda x: x.decode('utf-8')
)

# Notification delivery logic
def send_notification(user_id, message, channel="email"):
    if channel == "email":
        # Use SendGrid API to send email
        requests.post(
            "https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send",
            headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY"},
            json={
                "personalizations": [{"to": [{"email": f"user{user_id}@example.com"}]}],
                "from": {"email": "noreply@energy.com"},
                "subject": "Energy Notification",
                "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "value": message}]
            }
        )
    elif channel == "sms":
        # Use Twilio API to send SMS
        requests.post(
            "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json",
            auth=("YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID", "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"),
            data={
                "From": "+1234567890",
                "To": f"+1{user_id}",
                "Body": message
            }
        )
    print(f"Notification sent to {channel} for User {user_id}.")

# Background worker to process Kafka events
@app.route("/process_notifications", methods=["POST"])
def process_notifications():
    for message in consumer:
        event = message.value
        user_id = event["user_id"]
        message = event["message"]
        send_notification(user_id, message)
    return "Notifications processed.", 200

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)


```

-  Retry Logic for Failures

```
import time

def retry_send_notification(user_id, message, retries=3):
    for attempt in range(retries):
        try:
            send_notification(user_id, message)
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")
            time.sleep(2)  # Exponential backoff
    return False

```
