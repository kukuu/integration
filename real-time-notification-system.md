# Real-Time Notification System

The system will handle real-time notifications for energy customers, such as alerts for dynamic pricing changes, energy usage updates, or system outages. It must be scalable, fault-tolerant, and meet regulatory requirements for data privacy.

## Solution Steps

 ### Key Requirements

- Real-time notifications for customers (via SMS, email, push notifications).

- Scalability to handle millions of users and notifications.

- Fault-tolerance to ensure reliable delivery even during system failures.

- Regulatory compliance, ensuring GDPR compliance and protecting customer data.

### System Workflow

- Event Trigger: Notifications are triggered by events such as pricing changes, energy usage thresholds, or system outages.

- Event Streaming: Events are ingested in real time using tools like Apache Kafka or AWS SNS.

- Processing Layer: A microservice processes events, formats notifications, and decides the appropriate delivery channel (SMS, email, push).

- Notification Delivery: Delivery through external providers like Twilio, SendGrid, or Firebase.

- Monitoring and Retries: Failed notifications are logged, and retry mechanisms ensure eventual delivery.

- Key Components

i. Event Sources: Events originate from pricing APIs, energy usage data, or alerts.

ii. Event Streaming Layer: Kafka ensures scalable, fault-tolerant event ingestion.

iii. Data Processing Layer: Microservices handle business logic, such as formatting messages and routing them to the correct channel.

iv. Delivery Channels: Integrate with third-party services (e.g., Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email).

v. Observability: Tools like Prometheus or ELK Stack monitor delivery metrics and failures.
