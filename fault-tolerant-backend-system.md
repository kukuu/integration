# Practical Solution For Fault-Tolerant Distributed System

To design a fault-tolerant distributed system, the focus is on ensuring service availability, data consistency, and the ability to recover gracefully from failures. Below is a practical solution that includes architectural design, solution steps, and code examples.

##  Solution Steps

### Step 1: Load Balancing and Replication

- Goal: Distribute traffic evenly across backend services and ensure redundancy to avoid single points of failure.

- Use Load Balancers such as AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or NGINX to distribute traffic across backend services.

- Deploy services across multiple availability zones (AZs) or regions to ensure redundancy.

- Enable horizontal scaling using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes (K8s) or AWS ECS.

### Step 2: Circuit Breaker Patterns

- Goal: Prevent cascading failures across services.
  
- Implement circuit breaker patterns using libraries like Hystrix (Java) or Resilience4j (Java/Spring Boot).

- Create fallback mechanisms for degraded service operation.

- Monitor service health and allow for retry logic with exponential backoff.

### Step 3: Disaster Recovery and Backup

- Goal: Ensure continuity during large-scale outages.

- Use multi-region deployments with real-time data replication for disaster recovery.

- Store backups in object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) with versioning.

- Set up a disaster recovery plan to quickly restore critical services and data.

### Step 4: Eventual Consistency

- Goal: Allow distributed systems to achieve data consistency over time.

- Use event-driven architecture with messaging systems like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.

- Design idempotent APIs to ensure that repeated requests do not cause duplication.

- Implement saga patterns to manage distributed transactions.

### Step 5: Observability

- Goal: Provide visibility into system health and performance.

- Use Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualizing system health.

- Set up distributed logging with the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

- Configure alerts for anomalies and system failures using tools like PagerDuty.

## Architecture Design

Hereâ€™s a high-level architecture diagram for the fault-tolerant distributed system:

```
+-------------------+          +--------------------+
|  Load Balancer    |   --->   |    Service A       |
| (NGINX/AWS ELB)   |          | (Energy Readings)  |
+-------------------+          +--------------------+
          |                             |
          |                             |
          |          +--------------------+
          |   --->   |    Service B       |
          |          | (Billing/Reports)  |
          |          +--------------------+
          |
+-------------------------------------------------+
|         Event Streaming Platform (Kafka)       |
+-------------------------------------------------+
          |
+------------------+         +-------------------+
| Time-Series DB   |         | Relational DB     |
| (InfluxDB)       |         | (PostgreSQL)      |
+------------------+         +-------------------+
          |
+-------------------------------------------------+
|        Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus, ELK)  |
+-------------------------------------------------+

```

## Implementation Details

i. Load Balancing and Replication

- Setup with NGINX (Example Configuration for Multiple Backend Services):

 ```
http {
    upstream backend_services {
        server service_a:8080;
        server service_b:8081;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend_services;
        }
    }
}

  ```

ii. Circuit Breaker Pattern

- Using Resilience4j (Example in Spring Boot - JAVA):

```
@CircuitBreaker(name = "energyService", fallbackMethod = "fallbackEnergyService")
public String getEnergyData() {
    // Call to an external service
    return restTemplate.getForObject("http://external-service/energy", String.class);
}

public String fallbackEnergyService(Throwable t) {
    return "Fallback response: External service is unavailable.";
}

```

iii. Disaster Recovery

- Use AWS RDS for multi-region database replication: Enable Read Replica for disaster recovery in PostgreSQL (AWS CLI Example)

```
aws rds create-db-instance-read-replica \
    --db-instance-identifier mydb-replica \
    --source-db-instance-identifier mydb \
    --region us-east-2
```
