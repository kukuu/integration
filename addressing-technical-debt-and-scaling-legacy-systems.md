# Addressing Technical Debt and Scaling Legacy Systems

This solution provides a comprehensive roadmap to address technical debt and scale legacy systems. The gradual migration approach minimizes risks and ensures system availability, while observability and refactoring practices ensure long-term maintainability. By communicating trade-offs and balancing feature development with technical debt reduction, you ensure stakeholder buy-in and deliver measurable results.

## Solution Steps

 ### Refactoring Strategies: Strangler Pattern

- Identify business-critical components in the legacy system.

- Implement the Strangler Pattern: incrementally refactor and replace legacy components with modern, modular microservices.

- Route traffic through an API gateway to gradually transition functionality from legacy systems to new microservices, minimizing disruptions.

- Start with non-critical services (e.g., reporting systems) and progress to core services (e.g., billing or real-time energy consumption).

### Scalability Improvements

- Implement horizontal scaling by deploying services on cloud platforms like AWS, using tools such as AWS Auto Scaling Groups or Kubernetes.

- Add a caching layer with Redis or Memcached to handle frequently accessed data and reduce database load.

- Use database sharding or partitioning for large-scale data distribution and faster query performance.

### Tools and Techniques to Measure and Reduce Technical Debt

- Use SonarQube or Code Climate to measure and visualize technical debt (code complexity, duplication, and maintainability).

- Refactor high-complexity code and implement unit tests to ensure functional correctness.

- Use static code analysis tools to enforce coding standards.

- Perform periodic code reviews and architecture assessments to keep technical debt in check.

### Balancing Between New Features and Technical Debt

- Use the 70/30 rule: allocate 70% of development resources to new features and 30% to technical debt reduction.

- Schedule sprints dedicated to technical debt reduction within Agile workflows (e.g., every 3rd sprint).

- Identify low-effort, high-impact debt reduction tasks (e.g., replacing outdated libraries or removing redundant code).

### Communication Strategies with Stakeholders

- Clearly document technical debt items, their impact on business performance, and proposed solutions.

- Use simple language to explain trade-offs between fixing technical debt and delivering new features (e.g., reduced downtime, improved scalability).

- Develop a prioritized roadmap, balancing technical improvements and business needs.
Demonstrate ROI by showing how debt reduction improves key metrics (e.g., latency, scalability).


## Architecture Design

### High-Level Overview:

- API Gateway: Acts as a single entry point, routing traffic to legacy systems or refactored microservices.

- Microservices: Gradually replace legacy system functionality with scalable, loosely coupled services.

- Caching Layer: Introduce Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data.

- Data Layer: Use database sharding/partitioning and replication to ensure performance.

- Monitoring Tools: Implement tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track system performance and technical debt.

## Code Examples

i. Strangler Pattern: Transition Legacy Service to Microservices

```
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

# Legacy system endpoint
LEGACY_SYSTEM_URL = "http://legacy-system.example.com"

# New microservice endpoint
MICROSERVICE_URL = "http://new-microservice.example.com"

@app.route("/api/endpoint", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def proxy_request():
    if legacy_component_still_used():
        # Forward request to the legacy system
        response = requests.request(
            method=request.method,
            url=LEGACY_SYSTEM_URL + request.path,
            headers=request.headers,
            data=request.get_data(),
        )
    else:
        # Forward request to the new microservice
        response = requests.request(
            method=request.method,
            url=MICROSERVICE_URL + request.path,
            headers=request.headers,
            data=request.get_data(),
        )
    return jsonify(response.json()), response.status_code

def legacy_component_still_used():
    # Logic to determine if legacy system is still active for this service
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

```

ii. Horizontal Scaling with Kubernetes

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: energy-backend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: energy-backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: energy-backend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend-container
        image: energy-backend:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "256Mi"
          limits:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "512Mi"

```

iii. Adding Caching with Redis

```
import redis
import time

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

def get_customer_data(customer_id):
    # Check if data exists in Redis cache
    cached_data = redis_client.get(customer_id)
    if cached_data:
        return cached_data.decode('utf-8')
    
    # Simulate database query
    data = f"Customer {customer_id} data from DB"
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulating latency
    
    # Store data in cache with 5-minute expiry
    redis_client.setex(customer_id, 300, data)
    return data

customer_data = get_customer_data("12345")
print(customer_data)


```

## Tools for Monitoring and Measuring Technical Debt

- Use SonarQube for technical debt measurement:

```
sonar-scanner \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=EnergyBackend \
  -Dsonar.sources=src \
  -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 \
  -Dsonar.login=your_sonar_token

```

- Implement monitoring with Prometheus:

```
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'energy-backend'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']

```
