# Solution -  Migration from Monolith to Microservices

Transitioning from a monolithic application to a microservices-based architecture requires careful planning to ensure scalability, reliability, and business continuity. Below is a practical roadmap, architecture design, and implementation details for the migration.

## Solution Steps (Migration Roadmap)

### Step 1: Understand the Existing System

- Analyze the monolith:

- Identify tightly coupled components.


- Map key business domains, functionalities, and dependencies.

- Audit the database schema to identify shared data and potential data boundaries.

### Step 2: Identify Business Domains

- Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to break the monolith into smaller, independent domains (e.g., billing, pricing, account management, smart meter data ingestion).

- Define the bounded contexts for each domain.

### Step 3: Prioritize and Decompose

- Prioritize services based on business value and complexity:

i. Start with non-critical, low-risk components (e.g., reporting service).

ii. Gradually migrate core, high-value components.

### Step 4: API Gateway Implementation

- Introduce an API Gateway to manage communication between microservices and external clients.

- Implement features like routing, authentication, rate-limiting, and request aggregation.

### Step 5: Data Migration Strategy

- Choose between:

i. Database per service: Each service manages its own data.

ii. Shared database: Gradually transition from a shared DB to service-specific databases.

iii. Implement data synchronization or replication for gradual migration.

### Step 6: CI/CD Pipelines

i. Build CI/CD pipelines for deploying microservices independently.

ii. Automate testing, containerization, and deployment with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or AWS CodePipeline.

### Step 7: Ensure Minimal Downtime

- Use techniques like:

i. Blue-Green Deployment: Deploy new services alongside the old system.

ii. Canary Deployment: Gradually route traffic to new services.

iii. Implement monitoring to track performance and rollback plans for failures.


### Step 8: Observability and Monitoring

- Set up observability tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack) to monitor system health, performance, and logs.

                 |
        +----------------------------+
        | Shared Cache (Redis)       |
        +----------------------------+

Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes

```


## Implementation Details

### Identification of Business Domains
Using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), divide the monolith into independent microservices. For example:

- Billing Service:

i. Handles customer invoices and payments.

ii. Database: PostgreSQL (structured data).

- Pricing Service:

i. Calculates dynamic energy prices.

- Database: NoSQL or time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB).

- Account Service:

i. Manages user profiles and authentication.

- Database: PostgreSQL.

- Meter Data Service:

i. Processes and stores smart meter readings.

- Database: NoSQL or time-series database.

### API Gateway Design
Use tools like Kong, NGINX, or AWS API Gateway.

- API Gateway Configuration Example (NGINX):

```
server {
    listen 80;

    location /billing/ {
        proxy_pass http://billing-service:8080/;
    }

    location /pricing/ {
        proxy_pass http://pricing-service:8081/;
    }

    location /account/ {
        proxy_pass http://account-service:8082/;
    }
}


```

### Data Migration Strategy

- Implement the Strangler Fig Pattern:

i. Gradually replace monolithic components with microservices.

ii. Use database replication tools like Debezium or AWS DMS for data replication.

- Shared Database Transition Example:

i. Start with a shared database schema for all services.

ii. Gradually extract service-specific tables to their own databases.

iii. Implement an event-driven approach (e.g., Kafka) to synchronize data between services.


### CI/CD Pipelines

- Jenkins Pipeline for Microservices:

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t billing-service:latest .'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'pytest tests/'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
}


```
- Use Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.


### Techniques for Minimal Downtime

- Blue-Green Deployment:

i. Maintain two environments (blue = old, green = new).

ii. Route traffic to the new environment only after validation.

- Canary Deployment:

i. Gradually shift a small percentage of traffic to the new service.

ii. Roll back if errors occur.


### Example: Kubernetes Canary Deployment

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: billing-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: billing
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: billing
        version: canary
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: billing-service
        image: billing-service:canary


```

 ### Observability

- Prometheus and Grafana for Metrics:

i. Track latency, error rates, and resource utilization for each service.

- ELK Stack for Logs:
i. Aggregate logs from all services to debug issues during migration.

- Prometheus Configuration Example:

```
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'billing-service'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['billing-service:8080']
  - job_name: 'pricing-service'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['pricing-service:8081']


```

## Challenges and Trade-offs

- Database Transition:

i. A shared database simplifies initial migration but can become a bottleneck. Plan to transition to service-specific databases incrementally.

- Performance Overhead:

i. Microservices introduce network latency due to inter-service communication. Use caching (e.g., Redis) to reduce overhead.


## Leadership and Collaboration
i. Lead cross-functional discussions to identify business domains and prioritize migration.

ii. Collaborate with stakeholders (e.g., product teams, operations) to align migration goals with business outcomes.

iii. Encourage DevOps best practices to ensure smooth deployments and monitoring.
