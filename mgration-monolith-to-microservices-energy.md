# Solution -  Migration from Monolith to Microservices

Transitioning from a monolithic application to a microservices-based architecture requires careful planning to ensure scalability, reliability, and business continuity. Below is a practical roadmap, architecture design, and implementation details for the migration.

## Solution Steps (Migration Roadmap)

### Step 1: Understand the Existing System

- Analyze the monolith:

- Identify tightly coupled components.


- Map key business domains, functionalities, and dependencies.

- Audit the database schema to identify shared data and potential data boundaries.

### Step 2: Identify Business Domains

- Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to break the monolith into smaller, independent domains (e.g., billing, pricing, account management, smart meter data ingestion).

- Define the bounded contexts for each domain.

### Step 3: Prioritize and Decompose

- Prioritize services based on business value and complexity:

i. Start with non-critical, low-risk components (e.g., reporting service).

ii. Gradually migrate core, high-value components.

### Step 4: API Gateway Implementation

- Introduce an API Gateway to manage communication between microservices and external clients.

- Implement features like routing, authentication, rate-limiting, and request aggregation.

### Step 5: Data Migration Strategy

- Choose between:

i. Database per service: Each service manages its own data.

ii. Shared database: Gradually transition from a shared DB to service-specific databases.

iii. Implement data synchronization or replication for gradual migration.

### Step 6: CI/CD Pipelines

i. Build CI/CD pipelines for deploying microservices independently.

ii. Automate testing, containerization, and deployment with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or AWS CodePipeline.

### Step 7: Ensure Minimal Downtime

- Use techniques like:

i. Blue-Green Deployment: Deploy new services alongside the old system.

ii. Canary Deployment: Gradually route traffic to new services.

iii. Implement monitoring to track performance and rollback plans for failures.


### Step 8: Observability and Monitoring

- Set up observability tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack) to monitor system health, performance, and logs.

        +----------------------------+
        | Shared Cache (Redis)       |
        +----------------------------+

Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes

```


## Implementation Details

### Identification of Business Domains
Using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), divide the monolith into independent microservices. For example:

- Billing Service:

i. Handles customer invoices and payments.

ii. Database: PostgreSQL (structured data).

- Pricing Service:

i. Calculates dynamic energy prices.

- Database: NoSQL or time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB).

- Account Service:

i. Manages user profiles and authentication.

- Database: PostgreSQL.

- Meter Data Service:

i. Processes and stores smart meter readings.

- Database: NoSQL or time-series database.

### API Gateway Design
Use tools like Kong, NGINX, or AWS API Gateway.

- API Gateway Configuration Example (NGINX):

```
server {
    listen 80;

    location /billing/ {
        proxy_pass http://billing-service:8080/;
    }

    location /pricing/ {
        proxy_pass http://pricing-service:8081/;
    }

    location /account/ {
        proxy_pass http://account-service:8082/;
    }
}


```

### Data Migration Strategy

- Implement the Strangler Fig Pattern:

i. Gradually replace monolithic components with microservices.

ii. Use database replication tools like Debezium or AWS DMS for data replication.

- Shared Database Transition Example:

i. Start with a shared database schema for all services.

ii. Gradually extract service-specific tables to their own databases.

iii. Implement an event-driven approach (e.g., Kafka) to synchronize data between services.


### CI/CD Pipelines

- Jenkins Pipeline for Microservices:

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t billing-service:latest .'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'pytest tests/'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
}


```
- Use Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.


### Techniques for Minimal Downtime

- Blue-Green Deployment:

i. Maintain two environments (blue = old, green = new).

ii. Route traffic to the new environment only after validation.

- Canary Deployment:

i. Gradually shift a small percentage of traffic to the new service.

ii. Roll back if errors occur.
