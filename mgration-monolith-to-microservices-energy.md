# Solution: Migration from Monolith to Microservices

Transitioning from a monolithic application to a microservices-based architecture requires careful planning to ensure scalability, reliability, and business continuity. Below is a practical roadmap, architecture design, and implementation details for the migration.

## Solution Steps (Migration Roadmap)

### Step 1: Understand the Existing System

- Analyze the monolith:

- Identify tightly coupled components.


- Map key business domains, functionalities, and dependencies.

- Audit the database schema to identify shared data and potential data boundaries.

### Step 2: Identify Business Domains

- Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to break the monolith into smaller, independent domains (e.g., billing, pricing, account management, smart meter data ingestion).

- Define the bounded contexts for each domain.

### Step 3: Prioritize and Decompose

- Prioritize services based on business value and complexity:

i. Start with non-critical, low-risk components (e.g., reporting service).

ii. Gradually migrate core, high-value components.

### Step 4: API Gateway Implementation

- Introduce an API Gateway to manage communication between microservices and external clients.

- Implement features like routing, authentication, rate-limiting, and request aggregation.

### Step 5: Data Migration Strategy

- Choose between:

i. Database per service: Each service manages its own data.

ii. Shared database: Gradually transition from a shared DB to service-specific databases.

iii. Implement data synchronization or replication for gradual migration.

### Step 6: CI/CD Pipelines

i. Build CI/CD pipelines for deploying microservices independently.

ii. Automate testing, containerization, and deployment with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or AWS CodePipeline.

### Step 7: Ensure Minimal Downtime

- Use techniques like:

i. Blue-Green Deployment: Deploy new services alongside the old system.

ii. Canary Deployment: Gradually route traffic to new services.

iii. Implement monitoring to track performance and rollback plans for failures.


### Step 8: Observability and Monitoring

- Set up observability tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack) to monitor system health, performance, and logs.
