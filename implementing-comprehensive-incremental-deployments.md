# Implementing Comprehensive Incremental Deployments
Incremental deployments are an approach to deploying software updates in smaller, manageable increments rather than deploying everything at once. The goal is to reduce risks, improve feedback cycles, and deliver new features more frequently.

By implementing these practices and leveraging appropriate tools, teams can achieve comprehensive incremental deployments, allowing them to release software updates more frequently and with greater confidence in the stability and quality of the releases.

Here are some practices and tools that can be used to implement comprehensive incremental deployments:

- Feature Toggles/Flags: Use feature toggles to enable or disable specific features during deployment. This allows you to control the rollout of new functionality and easily roll back if needed. Tools like LaunchDarkly or Unleash can help manage feature toggles.

- Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD): Implement automated CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and deploy code frequently and reliably. Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and CircleCI are popular CI/CD tools.
- Microservice: A Microservices architecture refers to an application which is constructed from a number of independent services called Microservices.  Each microservice is a self-contained module that performs a discrete group of functions.
    - Loose coupling since it decouples clients from services
    - Small individual components
    - Easy to maintain
    - Offers parallel development
    - Independent deployment
    - Rapid iteration
    - Feature additions - enrichments
    - Confidence with CI/CD
    - Improved availability since the message broker buffers messages until the consumer is able to process them
    - Supports a variety of communication patterns including request/reply, notifications, request/async response, 
       publish/subscribe, publish/async response etc
    - Agile compliant: The modular approach of Microservices architecture works well with an agile management style as it 
       supports the slicing and splitting up of smaller work increments and tasks which goes hand-in-hand with projects using 
       an agile methodology.
     - Reduced system downtime: Microservices provide the flexibility to change parts of the solution without affecting the solution as a whole which is key in providing a reliable solution without downtime for end users.

- Canary Deployment (Segmentation) : Deploy new features or updates to a small subset of users (the "canary" group) before rolling out to the entire user base. This helps identify issues early and minimize the impact of potential problems. Kubernetes and Istio can assist in canary deployments.

- Blue-Green Deployment: Maintain two identical environments, one active (blue) and the other inactive (green). Deploy updates to the inactive environment and switch traffic to the updated version once it's tested and verified. Tools like AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Docker Swarm can facilitate blue-green deployments.

- Automated Testing: Comprehensive test suites, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, help ensure the stability and quality of each incremental deployment.

- Monitoring and Alerts: Set up monitoring and alerting systems to quickly detect any issues in the production environment after deployment. Tools like Prometheus and Grafana can help monitor application performance.

- Rollback Mechanism: Plan for a rollback strategy in case of unexpected issues or failures during deployment. This could involve automatically rolling back to a previous version or fixing the problem and redeploying.
  Use version control systems like Git to keep track of code changes and easily revert or switch between different versions.

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Adopt IaC tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to manage and version infrastructure changes, ensuring consistent and reproducible deployments.
