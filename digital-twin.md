## Metre Reading (Electricity/Energy)
Creating a full-stack application with a Node.js backend and a React frontend that displays readings from an electricity meter can be quite comprehensive. 
Hereâ€™s a simplified version of the solution using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, React, and PostgreSQL.

## Summary

This example provides a basic full-stack application setup with a Node.js backend using Express and a React frontend. The backend fetches electricity meter readings from an external API and serves them via an endpoint. The frontend consumes this endpoint and displays the readings.

This setup can be extended with more features, error handling, database interactions, authentication, and other necessary functionalities as per requirements.
