There are many recognized architectural patterns and styles, among them:

```

1. Client-server ( 2-tier, 3-tier, n-tier, cloud computing exhibit this style)

2. Layered (or multilayered architecture)

3. Microservices architecture

4. Monolithic application

5. Micro-kernael (COTS/Plugin)

6. Event Driven

7. Publish/Subscribe

```
A monolithic application describes a single-tiered software application in which the user interface and data access code are combined into a single program from a single platform. A monolithic application is self-contained, and independent from other computing applications.

```

5. Component-based

6. Event Driven  / Implicit invocation
