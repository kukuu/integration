# Communication Protocols

- Immediate Implementation:

```

# 1. Synchronous REST/HTTP
- Service-to-service via API Gateway
- External API integrations

# 2. Database-level consistency  
- Shared PostgreSQL with transaction boundaries

# 3. Future: Event-driven (when needed)
- Redis/RabbitMQ for async workflows
- Webhook systems for external partners

```
