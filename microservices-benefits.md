# Microservices 

A Microservices architecture refers to an application which is constructed from a number of independent services called Microservices. Each microservice is a self-contained module that performs a discrete group of functions.

- Loose coupling since it decouples clients from services

- Small individual components

- Easy to maintain

- Offers parallel development

- Independent deployment

- Rapid iteration

- Feature additions - enrichments

- Confidence with CI/CD

- Improved availability since the message broker buffers messages until the consumer is able to process them

- Supports a variety of communication patterns including request/reply, notifications, request/async response, publish/subscribe, publish/async response etc

- Agile compliant: The modular approach of Microservices architecture works well with an agile management style as it supports the slicing and splitting up of smaller work increments and tasks which goes hand-in-hand with projects using an agile methodology.
Reduced system downtime: Microservices provide the flexibility to change parts of the solution without affecting the solution as a whole which is key in providing a reliable solution without downtime for end users.
