# Automated Tests

In this article, I have provided a comprehensive suite of automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using JavaScript and some popular testing libraries.

Let's assume you are working on a Node.js application with the following file structure:


- src/
  - app.js
  - calculator.js
- test/
  - unit/
    - calculator.test.js
  - integration/
    - app.test.js
  - e2e/
    - app.e2e.test.js
```


```
