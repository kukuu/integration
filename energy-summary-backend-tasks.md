# Energy Backend Architecture Responsibilities

## Scalable Energy Data Platform

Architect a system that ingests, processes, and stores energy usage data in near real-time. Use microservices for modularity, an event-driven architecture for scalability, and a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB) for historical energy data storage.

## Dynamic Pricing System

Design a backend system that calculates energy prices dynamically based on demand, time of day, and market conditions. Utilize distributed caching systems (e.g., Redis) and integrate machine learning algorithms for real-time decision-making.
High-Availability Systems

Implement load balancing strategies using tools like AWS ALB or NGINX. Use auto-scaling groups and replication to ensure services remain available under high demand.

## Energy Billing System

Design an architecture that integrates real-time energy consumption data, dynamic pricing, and user billing. Ensure accurate calculations, data consistency, and secure payment processing.

## Fault-Tolerant and Reliable Systems

Implement strategies like the circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures and retries with exponential backoff to handle transient issues gracefully.
Create disaster recovery strategies using cloud tools like AWS Backup, multi-region replication, and periodic snapshots.

## Event-Driven Architecture

Use a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for decoupling services and handling asynchronous events, such as customer notifications or billing updates.

## Green Energy Integration

Architect backend systems that integrate green energy sources (e.g., solar, wind) into the energy grid, tracking energy production and customer usage in real-time.
